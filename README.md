# Sutton And Barto Reinforcement Learning Solutions
This repo is my solutions for Sutton and Barto's Reinforcement Learning Book.

The book (pdf and codes) can be download directly here from the authors http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html

The solutions for the examples are written in Lisp with very limited comments that makes it hard to follow. Therefore, I will upload my solutions here with as much details as possible. Most of the codes are written in C++ with visualization is done in Python.

This is not completed yet.
